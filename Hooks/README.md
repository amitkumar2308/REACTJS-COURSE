## Features

- **Increment Counter**: Users can increment the counter value by clicking the "ADD VALUE" button.
- **Decrement Counter**: Users can decrement the counter value by clicking the "Remove" button, with a safeguard against going negative.
- **User Feedback**: An alert is displayed if the user attempts to decrease the counter below zero.
